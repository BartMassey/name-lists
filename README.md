# Lists Of Names
Bart Massey 2016

These lists of names are intended to be of use when a nonce
name is needed for something--for example, in anonymizing
student assignments.

Names that would not work well as identifiers--multi-word
names and names with punctuation--have been stricken.  On
the other hand, no effort has been made to expurgate these
lists by content, so watch for potentially inappropriate
names (e.g. Hagg, Loon, Aholehole) when using them.

* *cities.txt* (183) -- Names of Oregon cities, from Wikipedia.

* *counties.txt* (35) -- Names of Oregon counties, from Wikipedia.

* *elements.txt* (92) -- Names of the first 92 chemical
  elements, from Wikipedia.

* *fish.txt* (510) -- Common names of fish, from Wikipedia.

* *lakes.txt* (83) -- Names of Oregon lakes, from
  Wikipedia.  This list includes only names that normally
  end in "Lake".

* *trees.txt* (43) -- Common names of Oregon trees, from Oregon
  State University.

* *names.txt* (2000) -- Most-used US baby names of 2011,
  from US SSA via http://babynamewizard.com .

not to be copyrightable. To avoid any ambiguity, they are
